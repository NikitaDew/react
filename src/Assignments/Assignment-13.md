# Types of testing

`Unit Testing `
Unit testing is the process of checking small pieces of code to ensure that the individual parts of a program work properly on their own, speeding up testing strategies and reducing wasted tests.

`Integration Testing`
Integration testing ensures that an entire, integrated system meets a set of requirements. It is performed in an integrated hardware and software environment to ensure that the entire system functions properly.

`End to End Testing `
End to end testing is a technique that tests the application’s workflow from beginning to end to make sure everything functions as expected.

`Performance Testing `
Performance testing examines the speed, stability, reliability, scalability, and resource usage of a software application under a specified workload.

`Manual testing`
Manual testing is the most hands-on type of testing and is employed by every team at some point. Of course, in today’s fast-paced software development lifecycle, manual testing is tough to scale.

`Automated testing`
Automated testing uses test scripts and specialized tools to automate the process of software testing.
